The income and property of the Cooperative from wherever derived shall be applied solely in promoting the Cooperative’s objectives.

The Cooperative is not established or conducted for private gain: any surplus or assets are used principally for the benefit and promotion of the objectives.

 - gather donations;
 - own and take responsibility for the Naamio domain names (.cloud, .foundation, .coop, .dev, .app, etc.), branding and marketing;
 - arrange the publication of artifacts, including, but not limited to, protocols, standards, software, and hardware, with responsibility for the tools and documentation that support such artifacts.
 - publish websites;
 - manage any future IANA-style allocations for Naamio projects, such as:
   - Custom URI schemes.
   - TCP port allocations.
   - .well-known URIs
 - ensure that Naamio promotion is happening (including ensuring that meetups, events, and other such community activity is supported).

In the future the Cooperative shall:

 - Contract entities to work on Naamio projects if such contracts help the Cooperative to fulfil its objectives and obey the Guiding Principles.

## 10. Membership

The Cooperative must maintain a register of members.

Members shall be approved by the Guardians.

The rules may specify one-off or annual fees required to entitle an individual to be a member.

No corporation, or other non-human legal entity can be a member of the Cooperative.

All members must disclose any affiliations or associations and if conflicts are upheld by the Guardians the member cannot be admitted.

Every person who wishes to become a member shall deliver an application for membership in such form (and containing such information) as the Guardians require and executed by them. 

Membership is not transferable to anyone else.

Membership is terminated if the Member concerned:

 - gives written notice of resignation provided that, on their resignation, at least two Members remain;

 - ceases to be a member of the Board;

 - dies or ceases to exist; 

 - otherwise in accordance with the Articles or as stated the rules of the Cooperative.

Members are entitled to:

 - receive the accounts of the Cooperative for each financial year;

 - receive an annual written report on the Cooperative’s activities; and

 - appoint reporting accountants or auditors for the Cooperative (unless such accountants or auditors are automatically deemed reappointed).

The Board shall call a general meeting if required to do so by the members.

## 11. Indemnifying the Guardians, officers and auditors

Guardians, other officer(s) and auditor(s) of the Cooperative may be indemnified out of the assets of the Cooperative (at the Cooperative’s discretion) against any liability incurred by them in that capacity in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in their favor or in which they are acquitted or in connection with any application in which relief is granted to them by the court from liability for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the affairs of the Cooperative.

## 12. Sharing revenue

The Cooperative will decide regularly (no more than every 12-months) at a special meeting whether to distribute revenue to members and what percentage of revenue to distribute under the Membership Shared Revenue pool.

Such distribution is undertaken as remuneration for efforts to support the Cooperative and the Rules will determine how the distribution is made, unless the special meeting appends an alteration to those rules for the current payment period.

The scheduling for the payment distribution will be determined in the special meeting.

No payment distribution shall be permitted if it:

 - places the Cooperative in financial jeopardy; or
 - exceeds the post-tax profit for the latest fiscal period.

Guardians will not receive separate funding pool beyond the Membership Shared Revenue. 

## 13. Asset Lock

The Cooperative shall not transfer any of its assets other than for full consideration.

Provided the conditions in the Articles are satisfied, this Article shall not apply to:

 1. the transfer of assets to any specified asset-locked body, or (with the consent of the Regulator) to any other asset-locked body; and
 2. the transfer of assets made for the benefit of the community other than by way of a transfer of assets into an asset-locked body.
 3. The conditions are that the transfer of assets must comply with any restrictions on the transfer of assets for less than full consideration which may be set out elsewhere in the Articles of the Cooperative.

If:

 1. the Cooperative is wound up under the Insolvency Act; and
 2. all its liabilities have been satisfied, any residual assets shall be given or transferred to the asset-locked body specified below.

For the purposes of this Article, the Guardians (with the consent of the Regulator) shall nominate an asset-locked body, whose restrictions on distributions are no less onerous than those set out in the Cooperative’s Articles, as the recipient of the Cooperative’s assets under the Articles.
 

## 14. Conflicts

The property and funds of the Cooperative must be used for promoting the objectives.

The Guardians may, in accordance with the requirements set out in this article, authorize any Conflict proposed to them by any Guardian which would, if not authorized, involve a Guardian (an "Interested Guardian") breaching their duty to avoid conflicts of interest.

Alternatively, any Conflict may be authorized by a Special Resolution of the Members.

Any authorization by Guardians shall be effective, only if:
 
 1. to the extent permitted, the matter in question shall have been proposed by any Guardian for the consideration in the same way that other matter may be proposed to the Guardians under the provisions of these Articles or in such other manner as the Guardians may determine;
 2. any requirement as to the quorum for consideration of the relevant matter is met without counting the Interested Guardian; and
 3. the matter was agreed to without the Interested Guardian voting or would have been agreed to if the Interested Guardian's vote had not been counted.

Any authorization of a Conflict (whether at the time of giving the authorization or subsequently) may:

 1. extend to any actual or potential conflict of interest which may reasonably be expected to arise out of the matter or situation so authorized;
 2. provide that the Interested Guardian be excluded from the receipt of documents and information and the participation in discussions (whether at meetings of the Guardians or otherwise) related to the Conflict.
 3. provide that the Interested Guardian shall or shall not be eligible to vote in respect of any future decision of the Guardians in relation to any resolution related to the Conflict;
 4. impose upon the Interested Guardian such other terms for the purposes of dealing with the Conflict as the Guardians see fit;
 5. provide that, where the Interested Guardian obtains, or has obtained (through his involvement in the Conflict and otherwise than through his position as a Guardian of the Cooperative) information that is confidential to a third-party, they shall not be obliged to disclose that information to the Cooperative, or to use it in relation to the Cooperative's affairs where to do so would amount to a breach of that confidence; and
 6. permit the Interested Guardian to absent themself from the discussion of matters relating to the Conflict at any meeting of the Guardians and be excused from reviewing papers prepared by, or for, the Guardians to the extent they relate to such matters.

Where the Guardians or Members authorize a Conflict, the Interested Guardian shall be obliged to conduct themself in accordance with any terms and conditions imposed by the Guardians or Members in relation to the Conflict.

The Guardians or Members, as the case may be, may revoke or vary an authorization they have given at any time, but this shall not affect anything done by the Interested Guardian prior to such revocation or variation in accordance with the terms of such authorization.

A Guardian is not required, by reason of being a Guardian (or because of the fiduciary relationship established by reason of being a Guardian), to account to the Cooperative for any remuneration, profit or other benefit which they derive from or in connection with a relationship involving a Conflict which has been authorized by the Guardians in accordance with these Articles or by the Cooperative in general meeting (subject in each case to any terms, limits or conditions attaching to that authorization) and no contract shall be liable to be avoided on such grounds.

## 16. Liability

The liability of members is limited.

Every Guardian promises, if the Cooperative is dissolved while they remain a member or within one year after they cease to be a member, to pay up to EUR 1 towards:

 - payment of those debts and liabilities of the Cooperative incurred before they ceased to be a member;
 - payment of the costs, charges and expenses of winding up; and
 - the adjustment of rights of contributors among themselves.

## 17. Communications

All notices (except notices of meetings given to the Guardians) shall be in writing.

Notices and other documents to be served on Members or Guardians under the Articles or legally may be served by suitable electronic means provided the Cooperative has complied with regulatory requirements in relation to the service of such notices.

Any notice given in accordance with these Articles is to be treated for all purposes as having been received:

1.	24 hours after being sent;
2.	As soon as the recipient acknowledges actual receipt.

A technical defect in service of which the Guardians are unaware at the time does not invalidate decisions taken at a meeting.

Documents and notices may be sent to the Cooperative by electronic means to the address specified by the Cooperative for that purpose and such documents and notices sent to the Cooperative are sufficiently authenticated if the identity of the sender is confirmed in the way the Cooperative has specified.

## 18. Sponsorship

Sponsorship will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the members as long as:

 1. the sponsor has not taken actions known by the Cooperative to be in conflict to the Objectives or Principles of the Cooperative in the past 12-months.
 2. the sponsor has not made statements known by the Cooperative to be in conflict to the Objectives or Principles of the Cooperative in the past 12-months.
 3. the sponsor has no investments known by the Cooperative to be in conflict to the Objectives or Principles of the Cooperative in the past 12-months.
 4. the sponsor has no products or services known by the Cooperative to be in conflict to the Objectives or Principles of the Cooperative in the past 12-months.

The aim of these rules is to ensure that financial viability is not gained from entities not aligned with the Cooperative's Objectives and Principles and therefore does not malign the Cooperative 's own efforts or have the potential to sway the Cooperative's efforts.

## 19. Minutes 

Minutes are kept for the following purposes:

 - recording the names and addresses of all members; and
 - appointments and retirements of Guardians;
 - the appointment of officers by the Guardians; and
 - all proceedings at meetings of the Cooperative and of the Guardians and of committees constituted including the names of Guardians and members (as appropriate) present at each such meeting.

## 20. Dissolution

If upon the winding up or dissolution of the Cooperative there remains, after the satisfaction of all its debts and liabilities, any property whatsoever, the same shall be given or transferred to another body or bodies (charitable or otherwise) having objects similar to the objectives of the Cooperative.

## 21. Rules of the Cooperative
